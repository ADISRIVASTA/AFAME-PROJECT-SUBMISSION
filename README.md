IRIS DATASET CLASSIFICATION
The Dataset:

The Iris dataset is a classic example in machine learning. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species:

Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica
Each sample has four features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
The goal is to use these features to build a model that can accurately predict the species of a new, unseen flower.
